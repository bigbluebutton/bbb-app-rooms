# Puma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers: a minimum and maximum.
# Any libraries that use thread pools should be configured to match
# the maximum value specified for Puma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum; this matches the default thread size of Active Record.

threads_count = ENV.fetch('RAILS_MAX_THREADS') { 5 }
threads(threads_count, threads_count)

# Specifies the `port` that Puma will listen on to receive requests; default is 3000.
#
port(ENV.fetch('PORT') { 3000 })

# Specifies the `environment` that Puma will run in.
#
environment(ENV.fetch('RAILS_ENV') { 'development' })

# Specifies the number of `workers` to boot in clustered mode.
# Workers are forked webserver processes. If using threads and workers together
# the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.
# Workers do not work on JRuby or Windows (both of which do not support
# processes).
#
workers(ENV.fetch('WEB_CONCURRENCY') { 2 })

# Use the `preload_app!` method when specifying a `workers` number.
# This directive tells Puma to first boot the application and load code
# before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
# process behavior so workers use less memory.

# Allow puma to be restarted by `rails restart` command.
