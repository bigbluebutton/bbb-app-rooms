* Fix the datetime input in mobile by disabling the native integration. Will show
  the selector just as it does in a desktop browser.
* Configure the session cookie with SameSite=None and Secure. Necessary to open the application
  in an iframe, Chrome started blocking cookies otherwise.
* When creating a meeting, initiate it with attributes from its room, that can be configured
  using custom parameters in the launch.
* Add custom parameters to the launch to enable/disable edition of the flags `all_moderators`
  and `wait_moderator`. The parameters are called `allow_all_moderators` and `allow_wait_moderator`.
  If they are not informed, users are allowed to edit the attributes when editing and creating
  scheduled meetings. If they are informed with `true` (has to be this value), users are also
  allowed to edit the attributes. If they are informed with any other value, users will not
  see the attributes in the views, will not be allowed to edit them and they will assume
  their default values when used (`wait_moderator=true` and `all_moderators=false`).
  * New migration to include the attributes `allow_all_moderators` and `allow_wait_moderator`
    on the table `rooms`.
